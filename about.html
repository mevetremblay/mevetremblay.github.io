				<h1>ABOUT</h1>
				<p>Hi, I&#8217m a baking addict. But first, I&#8217m Kyoko. I like to paint, run, and bake. I watch a lot of Food Network programing (way more than I would admit publicly) and eat way too much sugar but I usually go for a run right after so it&#8217s all good, right? The kitchen is where my creative juices flow and Girl gone baking is where I can share it all with you.</p><p>By day, I am a Project Manager for cancer research hospital, but during the evenings and weekends I am in the kitchen cooking and baking delicious desserts. I started this blog as a way to chronicle my culinary journey and expand my photography skills. What you&#8217ll find here are some of my favorite desserts: muffins, cookies, cupcakes, cakes, pies, tarts, breads, and pastries, all made from scratch. My hope is that you leave the site with the insatiable urge to run into your kitchen and whip up what you&#8217ve seen here, and the confidence to know that you can do it.</p><p>I hope you find my blog inviting, fun and full of deliciously addictive recipes.</p>
